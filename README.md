In order to build the project, first create a `build` directory if there's no such directory exsiting. Then navigate to it:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```

Next run `cmake` to configure project:

```
cmake ../Code
```


Then to build project, use

```
cmake --build .
```

Now in the `build` dir, you can find the executable file `main`. To run it, use:

```
./main
